# DevOps Lab Portfolio – CI/CD & GitOps (Sydney Track)

This repository showcases my hands-on **DevOps & Platform Engineering** journey, transitioning from an **Infrastructure Support Engineer (MSP)** into a **DevOps / Platform Engineer** role.

The work demonstrates **real-world DevOps practices** including Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, containerisation, Kubernetes, Helm, and GitOps with ArgoCD.

## 🚀 Capstone Project (Start Here)

### 🔹 Week3 App – End-to-End GitOps CI/CD Pipeline  
📁 **Folder:** [`project-week3-app/`](./project-week3-app)

**What this project demonstrates:**
- CI with **Jenkins** (automated pipeline)
- Containerisation with **Docker**
- Image versioning & push to Docker Hub
- GitOps-based CD using **Helm + ArgoCD**
- Kubernetes deployment with auto-sync, self-heal, and prune
- Dev branch–based workflow (production-style)

**CI/CD Flow:**
Git (dev branch)
→ Jenkins (build & tag image)
→ Docker Hub
→ GitOps commit (Helm values.yaml)
→ ArgoCD auto-sync
→ Kubernetes deployment



This project reflects how modern DevOps teams deploy applications **without direct kubectl access**, using Git as the single source of truth.
